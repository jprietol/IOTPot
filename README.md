# IOT POT RASPBERRY PI PICO

## Introducion 

<p> In this project, I pretend to teach how use the raspberry pi pico and esp32 programming in C to hardware and React to view dataset in different device. Through design and implementation of an IOT pot, I try control the humid in the ground to say its porcent of water,  create a alert when the plant need water and send the datas to a client to look its state in real time. </p>

## State of the project

<p> This project is in development in this moment, some functions have not integrated yet. </p>



## About the code

<p> In the repository is the raspberry pi pico code. Which one, its function is convert analog signals of humidity sensor to process the datas, turn on/off LEDs depending on the how much water has the ground and send the datas trought I2C as soon as changing its state. An ESP32 recive the information and its general function is to do of  server, then, comunnicate the informarion to can be to view in a client. </p>

<p> clearly again, <b> in this repository only is raspberry pi pico code </b>. If you need ESP32 code is : </p>

<p> Also, <b> in this repository is the project to can see the information in the client </b>, trought React technology :</p>

## Contributing 

<p> As the intention of development the project is show differents concepts when we programmed microcontrollers in C. This is open source to allows  better scale and fix, generating supports by other people or organizations. </p>

## Requirements
